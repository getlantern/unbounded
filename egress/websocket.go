// errorlessWebSocketPacketConn adapts a websocket.Conn for use as a net.PacketConn, and it performs
// one additional trick: if its underlying websocket.Conn is closed such that reads and writes
// return errors, it will intercept and hide those errors from the caller. The purpose of this
// functionality is to enable QUIC connection migration from WebSocket A to B, when B is not yet
// known at the moment that A disconnects. Put another way: if you establish a QUIC connection over
// an errorlessWebSocketPacketConn, the underlying WebSocket can disconnect and go away, but your
// QUIC connection will not close, because its transport sneakily hides the read and write errors.
// This gives you an opportunity to migrate your QUIC connection to a new errorlessWebSocketPacketConn
// at some point in the future. Intercepted *read* errors are sent over the readError channel.
// Currently, intercepted *write* errors are simply discarded.

		// XXX nelson 08/18/2025: This code path remains the source of much confusion. Let me unpack
		// some observations that led us to to the present behavior. First, we observed that if you
		// never return an error from ReadFrom, then quic-go will continue to call ReadFrom on old
		// transports forever -- even if you've switched to a new path *and* closed the old paths, and
		// even if the QUIC connection is *closed completely!* Yes, you read that correctly: when we
		// close a QUIC connection, we discover that some internal process of quic-go is still calling
		// ReadFrom on all of its historical transports, presumably because we never returned an error.
		// However, we never found a way to return an error that worked. We attempted a design wherein
		// ReadFrom would, upon intercepting the first error, block until someone called Close() on the
		// errorlessWebSocketPacketConn, at which point it would return an error of our own choosing. But
		// we discovered that an error returned by transport A is received by the AcceptStream handler
		// of transport B, even after we'd migrated from A to B -- and that an error returned by
		// transport A puts the entire connection in a permanently bad state -- you can no longer call
		// AcceptStream on the connection, as it will forever return a "transport closed" error. So we
		// find ourselves in a pickle: if we do return an error, we bork the connection, and if we don't
		// return an error, we seem to never release the resource. Examining the call stack before the
		// infinite calls to ReadFrom, it looks like runtime.Goexit was implicated, and thus:
		runtime.Goexit()
